# Clientpanel

## Brief Introduction

It is my **first Angular project**, and this project is basically about a complete client management system that uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which is a cloud database maintained by Google. It includes real-time databases, authentication storage and much more.
The reason why I started building the client panel application is that to enhance my Front-End development skills to the next level. Looks pretty simple on the surface in comparison with big applications, but it's quite an in-depth app.

Generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0

Integration with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) via [AngularFire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2)

[Angular Flash Messaging](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/angular-flash/)

## Features

+ Components are all separately nested inside of the dashboard component.
+ Basic CRUD operations with Firebase.
+ Settings component that could disable the entire registration and could disable balance on add/edit.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
